                <p>Introduction. The Yellow Nineties Online publishes primary texts from the 1890s and secondary texts written by critics of fin-de-siècle culture. Both kinds of
texts are marked up in TEI. As a dynamic structure, a scholarly website is
always in process. Our decisions in selecting and presenting materials on The
 Yellow Nineties Online are governed by the following principles. Editorial
Principles 1. Primary materials Our editorial method for the facsimile editionspublished here is informed by social-text editing principles. The editors understand text as including visual and verbal printed material, including non-referential physical elements such as page design, ornament, and binding. We view any text as the outcome of a collaborative process that has specific material manifestations at precise historical moments. We have chosen to
 reproduce The Yellow Book in facsimile form at its moment of first publication.
The social moment—and our editorial horizon—is demarcated by the decade of the
1890s as experienced in and around the London contexts of The Yellow Book’scontributors and associates. The project’s principal interest is in presenting the text’s physical components in its first edition, with attention to itsproduction and reception. Copy-text for The Yellow Book and any other primary material edited on The Yellow Nineties Online is the first edition unless
 otherwise noted. The Yellow Book is presented in facsimile, using double-page
opening of the flip-book function. In addition, the physical features, verbal
texts, and visual images of each Yellow Book volume are marked up in TEI and available in both xml and PDF formats. Annotations to the facsimile edition are
kept to a minimum. Commentary is available in the site’s associated secondary
 materials. 2. Secondary materials In addition to providing the publication
zNineties ...Preferred font is Arial 12. The spelling standard is Canadian. </p>

                    continuity only on the supposition that<lb/> I had been cheap. I rather resented
                    the practice of fathering<lb/> all flatness on my late protector, who was in his
                    unhonoured<lb/> grave; but as I had my way to make I found matter enough
                    for<lb/> complacency in being on a <q>"staff."</q> At the same time I was<lb/>
                    aware that I was exposed to suspicion as a product of the old<lb/> lowering
                    system. This made me feel that I was doubly bound to<lb/></p><fw type="catchword">have</fw><pb n="16"/><fw type="pageNum">8</fw><fw type="runningHead">The Death of the Lion</fw><p>have ideas, and had doubtless been at the bottom of my proposing<lb/> to
                        <persName type="fictional">Mr. Pinhorn</persName> that I should lay my lean
                    hands on <persName type="fictional">Neil Paraday</persName>.<lb/> I remember
                    that he looked at me first as if he had never heard of<lb/> this celebrity, who
                    indeed at that moment was by no means in the<lb/> middle of the heavens; and
                    even when I had knowingly explained<lb/> he expressed but little confidence in
                    the demand for any such<lb/> matter. When I had reminded him that the great
                    principle on<lb/> which we were supposed to work was just to create the
                    demand<lb/> we required, he considered a moment and then rejoined: <q>"I
                        see;<lb/> you want to write him up."</q></p><p><q>"Call it that if you like."</q></p><p><q>"And what's your inducement?"</q></p><p><q>"Bless my soul — my admiration!"</q></p><p><persName type="fictional">Mr. Pinhorn</persName> pursed up his mouth. <q>"Is
                        there much to be done<lb/> with him?"</q></p><p><q>"Whatever there is, we should have it all to ourselves for he <lb/> hasn't
                        been touched."</q></p><p>This argument was effective, and <persName type="fictional">Mr.
                        Pinhorn</persName> responded:</p><p><q>"Very well, touch him."</q> Then he added: <q>"But where can you<lb/> do
                        it?"</q></p><p><q>"Under the fifth rib!"</q> I laughed.</p><p><persName type="fictional">Mr. Pinhorn</persName> stared. <q>"Where's
                    that?"</q></p><p><q>"You want me to go down and see him?"</q> I inquired, when I<lb/> had enjoyed
                    his visible search for this obscure suburb.</p><p><q>"I don't <q>"want"</q> anything — the proposal's your own. But you<lb/>
                        must remember that that's the way we do things <emph rend="italic">now</emph>,"</q> said <persName type="fictional">Mr.<lb/>
                        Pinhorn</persName>, with another dig at <persName type="fictional">Mr.
                        Deedy</persName>.</p><p>Unregenerate as I was, I could read the queer implications<choice><sic>o</sic><corr> of</corr></choice><lb/> this speech. The present owner's superior virtue as well as
                    his<lb/> deeper craft spoke in his reference to the late editor as one of<lb/>
                    that baser sort who deal in false representations. <persName type="fictional">Mr. Deedy</persName><lb/></p><fw type="catchword">Mr. Deedy</fw><pb n="17"/><fw type="runningHead">By Henry James</fw><fw type="pageNum">9</fw><p>would as soon have sent me to call on <persName type="fictional">Neil

                    such scruples presented<lb/> themselves as mere ignoble thrift to his successor,
                    whose own<lb/> sincerity took the form of ringing door-bells and whose
                    definition<lb/> of genius was the art of finding people at home. It was as if
                        <persName type="fictional">Mr.<lb/> Deedy</persName> had published reports
                    without his young men's having, as<lb/><persName type="fictional">Mr. Pinhorn</persName> would have said, really been
                    there. I was unre-<lb/> generate, as I have hinted, and I was not concerned to
                    straighten<lb/> out the journalistic morals of my chief, feeling them indeed to
                    be<lb/> an abyss over the edge of which it was better not to peer. Really<lb/>
                    to be there this time moreover was a vision that made the idea of<lb/> writing
                    something subtle about <persName type="fictional">Neil Paraday</persName> only
                    the more<lb/> inspiring. I would be as considerate as even <persName type="fictional">Mr. Deedy</persName> could<lb/> have wished, and yet I
                    should be as present as only <persName type="fictional">Mr.
                    Pinhorn</persName><lb/> could conceive. My allusion to the sequestered manner in which<lb/><persName type="fictional">Mr. Paraday</persName> lived (which had formed part
                    of my explanation,<lb/> though I knew of it only by hearsay) was, I could
                    divine, very<lb/> much what had made <persName type="fictional">Mr.
                        Pinhorn</persName> bite. It struck him as in-<lb/> consistent with the
                    success of his paper that any one should be so<lb/> sequestered as that.
                    Moreover, was not an immediate exposure of<lb/> everything just what the public
                    wanted? <persName type="fictional">Mr. Pinhorn</persName> effectually<lb/>
                    called me to order by reminding me of the promptness with which<lb/> I had met
                        <persName type="fictional">Miss Braby</persName> at <placeName type="city">Liverpool</placeName>, on her return from her fiasco in<lb/> the <placeName type="country">States</placeName>. Hadn't we published, while its freshness
                    and flavour<lb/> were unimpaired, <persName type="fictional">Miss
                        Braby</persName>'s own version of that great inter-<lb/> national episode? I
                    felt somewhat uneasy at this coupling of the<lb/> actress and the author, and I
                    confess that after having enlisted <persName type="fictional">Mr.<lb/>
                        Pinhorn</persName>'s sympathies I procrastinated a little. I had
                    succeeded<lb/> better than I wished, and I had, as it happened, work nearer
                    at<lb/> hand. A few days later I called on <persName type="fictional">Lord
                        Crouchley</persName> and carried<lb/> off in triumph the most unintelligible
                    statement that had yet</p><fw type="catchword">appeared</fw><pb n="18"/><fw type="pageNum">10</fw><fw type="runningHead">The Death of the Lion</fw><p>appeared of his lordship's reasons for his change of front. I thus<lb/> set in
                    motion in the daily papers columns of virtuous verbiage.<lb/> The following week
                    I ran down to <placeName type="city">Brighton</placeName> for a chat, as
                        <persName type="fictional">Mr.<lb/> Pinhorn</persName> called it, with
                        <persName type="fictional">Mrs. Bounder</persName>, who gave me, on the<lb/>
                    subject of her divorce, many curious particulars that had not been<lb/>
                    articulated in court. If ever an article flowed from the primal<lb/> fount it
                    was that article on <persName type="fictional">Mrs. Bounder</persName>. By this
                    rime, however,<lb/> I became aware that <persName type="fictional">Neil
                        Paraday</persName>'s new book was on the point of<lb/> appearing, and that
                    its approach had been the ground of my<lb/> original appeal to <persName type="fictional">Mr. Pinhorn</persName>, who was now annoyed with me<lb/>
                    for having lost so many days. He bundled me off—we would at<lb/> least
                    not lose another. I have always thought his sudden alertness a<lb/> remarkable
                    example of the journalistic instinct. Nothing had<lb/> occurred, since I first
                    spoke to him, to create a visible urgency,<lb/> and no enlightenment could
                    possibly have reached him. It was a<lb/> pure case of professional <emph rend="italic">flair</emph>—he had smelt the coming glory as<lb/> an
                    animal smells its distant prey.</p></div><div type="part" n="2"><space/><head>II</head><space/><p>I may as well say at once that this little record pretends in no<lb/> degree to
                    be a picture either of my introduction to <persName type="fictional">Mr.
                        Paraday</persName><lb/> or of certain proximate steps and stages. The scheme
                    of my<lb/> narrative allows no space for these things and in any case a
                    pro-<lb/> hibitory sentiment would be attached to my recollection of so
                    rare<lb/> an hour. These meagre notes are essentially private, and if they<lb/>
                    see the light the insidious forces that, as my story itself shows,<lb/> make at
                    present for publicity will simply have overmastered my<lb/> precautions. The
                    curtain fell lately enough on the lamentable</p><fw type="catchword">drama</fw><pb n="19"/><fw type="runningHead">By Henry James</fw><fw type="pageNum">11</fw><p>drama. My memory of the day I alighted at <persName type="fictional">Mr.
                        Paraday</persName>'s door<lb/> is a fresh memory of kindness, hospitality,
                    compassion, and of the<lb/> wonderful illuminating talk in which the welcome was
                    conveyed.<lb/> Some voice of the air had taught me the right moment, the<lb/>
                    moment of his life at which an act of unexpected young allegiance<lb/> might
                    most come home. He had recently recovered from a long,<lb/> grave illness. I had
                    gone to the neighbouring inn for the night,<lb/> but I spent the evening in his
                    company, and he insisted the next<lb/> day on my sleeping under his roof. I had
                    not an indefinite leave:<lb/><persName type="fictional">Mr. Pinhorn</persName> supposed us to put out victims
                    through on the<lb/> gallop. It was later, in the office, that the step was
                    elaborated<lb/> and regulated. I fortified myself however, as my training
                    had<lb/> taught me to do, by the conviction that nothing could be more<lb/>
                    advantageous for my article than to be written in the very atmo-<lb/> sphere. I
                    said nothing to <persName type="fictional">Mr. Paraday</persName> about it, but
                    in the<lb/> morning, after my removal from the inn, while he was occupied
                    in<lb/> his study, as he had notified me that he should need to be, I com-<lb/>
                    mitted to paper the quintessence of my impressions. Then<lb/> thinking to
                    commend myself to <persName type="fictional">Mr. Pinhorn</persName> by my
                    celerity, I<lb/> walked out and posted my little packet before luncheon.
                    Once<lb/> my paper was written I was free to stay on, and if it was
                    designed<lb/> to divert attention from my frivolity in so doing I could
                    reflect<lb/> with satisfaction that I had never been so clever I don't mean
                    to<lb/> deny of course that I was aware it was much too good for <persName type="fictional">Mr.<lb/> Pinhorn</persName>; but I was equally conscious
                    that <persName type="fictional">Mr. Pinhorn</persName> had the<lb/> supreme
                    shrewdness of recognising from time to time the cases in<lb/> which an article
                    was not too bad only because it was too good,<lb/> There was nothing he loved so
                    much as to print on the right<lb/> occasion a thing he hated. I had begun my
                    visit to <persName type="fictional">Mr. Paraday</persName><lb/> on a Monday, and
                    on the Wednesday his book came out. A copy<lb/> of it arrived by the first post,
                    and he let me go out into the garden</p><fw type="catchword">with</fw><pb n="20"/><fw type="pageNum">12</fw><fw type="runningHead">The Death of the Lion</fw><p>with it immediately after breakfast. I read it from beginning to<lb/> end that
                    day, and in the evening he asked me to remain with him<lb/> the rest of the week
                    and over the Sunday.</p><p>That night my manuscript came back from <persName type="fictional">Mr.
                        Pinhorn</persName>,<lb/> accompanied with a letter, of which the gist was
                    the desire to<lb/> know what I meant by sending him such stuff. That was
                    the<lb/> meaning of the question, if not exactly its form, and it made my<lb/>
                    mistake immense to me. Such as this mistake was I could now<lb/> only look it in
                    the face and accept it. I knew where I had failed,<lb/> but it was exactly where
                    I couldn't have succeeded. I had been<lb/> sent down there to be personal, and
                    in point of fact I hadn't been<lb/> personal at all; what I had sent up to
                        <placeName type="city">London</placeName> was merely a little<lb/>
                    finicking, feverish study of my author's talent. Anything less<lb/> relevant to
                        <persName type="fictional">Mr. Pinhorn</persName>'s purpose couldn't well be
                    imagined, and<lb/> he was visibly angry at my having (at his expense, with a
                    second-<lb/> class ticket) approached the object of our arrangement only to
                    be<lb/> so deucedly distant. For myself, I knew but too well what had<lb/>
                    happened, and how a miracle — as pretty as some old miracle of<lb/>
                    legend — had been wrought on the spot to save me. There had<lb/> been a
                    big brush of wings, the flash of an opaline robe, and then,<lb/> with a great
                    cool stir of the air, the sense of an angel's having<lb/> swooped down and
                    caught me to his bosom. He held me only<lb/> till the danger was over, and it
                    all took place in a minute. With<lb/> my manuscript back on my hands I
                    understood the phenomenon<lb/> better, and the reflections I made on it are what
                    I meant, at the<lb/> beginning of this anecdote, by my change of heart.
                        <persName type="fictional">Mr. Pinhorn</persName>'s<lb/> note was hot only a
                    rebuke decidedly stern, but an invitation <lb/> immediately to send him (it was
                    the case to say so) the genuine<lb/> article, the revealing and reverberating
                    sketch to the promise of <lb/> which — and of which alone — I owed
                    my squandered privilege. A<lb/> week or two later I recast my peccant paper, and
                    giving it a</p><fw type="catchword">particular</fw><pb n="21"/><fw type="runningHead">By Henry James</fw><fw type="pageNum">13</fw><p>particular application to <persName type="fictional">Mr. Paraday</persName>'s new
                    book, obtained for it<lb/> the hospitality of another journal, where, I must
                    admit, <persName type="fictional">Mr. Pin-<lb/> horn</persName> was so far
                    justified that it attracted not the least attention.</p></div><div type="part" n="3"><space/><head>III</head><space/><p>I was frankly, at the end of three days, a very prejudiced critic,<lb/> so that
                    one morning when, in the garden, <persName type="fictional">Neil
                        Paraday</persName> had<lb/> offered to read me something I quite held my
                    breath as I listened.<lb/> It was the written scheme of another
                    book—something he had<lb/> put aside long ago, before his illness, and
                    lately taken out again to<lb/> reconsider. He had been turning it round when I
                    came down<lb/> upon him, and it had grown magnificently under this second<lb/>
                    hand. Loose, liberal, confident, it might have passed for a great<lb/>
                    gossiping, eloquent letter—the overflow into talk of an artist's<lb/>
                    amorous plan. The subject I thought singularly rich, quite the<lb/> strongest he
                    had yet treated; and this familiar statement of it, full<lb/> too of fine
                    maturities, was really, in summarised splendour, a mine<lb/> of gold, a
                    precious, independent work. I remember rather pro-<lb/> fanely wondering whether
                    the ultimate production could possibly<lb/> be so happy. His reading of the
                    epistle, at any rate, made me<lb/> feel as if I were, for the advantage of
                    posterity, in close corre-<lb/> spondence with him — were the
                    distinguished person to whom it had<lb/> been affectionately addressed. It was
                    high distinction simply to<lb/> be told such things. The idea he now
                    communicated had all the<lb/> freshness, the flushed fairness of the conception
                    untouched and<lb/> untried: it was <persName type="fictional">Venus</persName>
                    rising from the sea, before the airs had<lb/> blown upon her. I had never been
                    so throbbingly present at such<lb/> an unveiling. But when he had tossed the

                    alarm.</p><p><q>"My dear toaster, how, after all, are you going to do it?"</q> I<lb/> asked.

<q>"Isn't this practically a lone isle, and aren't you, as an encircling<lb/>
                        medium, tepid enough?"</q> he replied; alluding with a laugh to the<lb/>
                    wonder of my young admiration and the narrow limits of his little<lb/>
                    provincial home. <q>"Time isn't what I’ve lacked hitherto: the<lb/> question
                        hasn't been to find it, but to use it. Of course my<lb/> illness made a

                    — such pleasant eyes as he<lb/> had — in which, as I now recall
                    their expression, I seem to have<lb/> seen a dim imagination of his fate. He was
                    fifty years old, and<lb/> his illness had been cruel, his convalescence slow.
                        <q>"It isn't as if<lb/> I weren't all right."</q></p><p><q>"Oh, if you weren't all right I wouldn't look at you!"</q> I<lb/> tenderly
                    said.</p><p>We had both got up, quickened by the full sound of it all, and<lb/> he had
                    lighted a cigarette. I had taken a fresh one, and, with an<lb/> intenser smile,
                    by way of answer to my exclamation, he touched it<lb/> with the flame of his
                    match. <q>"If I weren't better I shouldn't have<lb/> thought of <emph rend="italic">that</emph>!"</q> He flourished his epistle in his

                        and almost anything that does that is horrible. <q>'We are happy<lb/> to
                            announce that <persName type="fictional">Mr. Paraday</persName>, the

                        dead?"</q> my companion asked.</p><p><q>"Dead — <foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="italic">passe encore</foreign>;
                        there's nothing so safe. One never<lb/> knows what a living artist may do
                        — one has mourned so many.<lb/> However, one must make the worst of
                        it; you must be as dead as <lb/> you can."</q></p><p><q>"Don't I meet that condition in having just published a book?"</q></p><p><q>"Adequately, let us hope; for the book is verily a master- piece."</q></p><p>At this moment the parlour-maid appeared in the door that<lb/> opened into the
                    garden: <persName type="fictional">Paraday</persName> lived at no great cost,
                    and the<lb/> frisk of petticoats, with a timorous <q>"Sherry, sir?"</q> was
                    about his<lb/> modest mahogany. He allowed hall his income to his wife,
                    from<lb/> whom he had succeeded in separating without redundancy of legend.<lb/>
                    I had a general faith in his having behaved well, and I had once, in<lb/><placeName type="city">London</placeName>, taken <persName type="fictional">Mrs.
                        Paraday</persName> down to dinner. He now turned to<lb/> speak to the maid,
                    who offered him, on a trait, some card or note,</p><fw type="catchword">while</fw><pb n="24"/><fw type="pageNum">16</fw><fw type="runningHead">The Death of the Lion</fw><p>while agitated, excited, I wandered to the end of the garden.<lb/> The idea of
                    his security became supremely dear to me, and I asked<lb/> myself if I were the
                    same young man who had come down a few<lb/> days before to scatter him to the
                    four winds. When I retraced<lb/> my steps he had gone into the house and the
                    woman (the second<lb/><placeName type="city">London</placeName> post had come in) had placed my
                    letters and a newspaper<lb/> on a bench. I sat down there to the letters, which
                    were a brief<lb/> business, and then, without heeding the address, took the
                    paper<lb/> from its envelope. It was the journal of highest renown, <title level="j" rend="italic">The<lb/> Empire</title> of that morning. It
                    regularly camee to <persName type="fictional">Paraday</persName>, but I<lb/>
                    remembered that neither of us had yet looked at the copy already<lb/> delivered.
                    This one had a great mark on the editorial page,<lb/> and, uncrumpling the
                    wrapper, I saw it to be directed to my host<lb/> and stamped with the name of
                    his publishers. I instantly divined<lb/> that <title level="j" rend="italic">The
                        Empire</title> had spoken of him, and I have not forgotten the<lb/> odd
                    little shock of the circumstance. It checked all eagerness and<lb/> made me drop
                    the paper a moment. As I sat there, conscious of<lb/> a palpitation, I think I
                    had a vision of what was to be. I had<lb/> also a vision of the letter I would
                    presently address to <persName type="fictional">Mr. Pinhorn</persName>,<lb/>
                    breaking as it were with <persName type="fictional">Mr. Pinhorn</persName>. Of
                    course, however,<lb/> the next minute the voice of <title level="j" rend="italic">The Empire</title> was in my ears.</p><p>The article was not, I thanked Heaven, a review; it was a<lb/> leader, the last
                    of three, presenting <persName type="fictional">Neil Paraday</persName> to the
                    human<lb/> race. His new book, the fifth from his hand, had been but a day<lb/>
                    or two out, and <title level="j" rend="italic">The Empire</title>, already aware
                    of it, fired, as if on the<lb/> birth of a prince, a salure of a whole column.
                    The guns had been<lb/> booming these three hours in the house without out
                    suspecting<lb/> them. The big blundering newspaper had discovered him, and<lb/>
                    now he was proclaimed and anointed and crowned. His place was<lb/> assigned him
                    as publicly as if a fat usher with a wand had pointed<lb/> to the topmost chair;
                    he was to pass up and still up, higher and</p><fw type="catchword">higher,</fw><pb n="25"/><fw type="runningHead">By Henry James</fw><fw type="pageNum">17</fw><p>higher, between the watching faces and the envious sounds — away<lb/> up
                    to the daïs and the throne. The article was a date; he had<lb/> taken rank at a
                    bound — waked up a national glory. A national<lb/> glory was needed, and
                    it was an immense convenience he was there.<lb/> What all this meant rolled over
                    me, and I fear I grew a little faint<lb/> —it meant so much more than I
                    could say <q>"yea"</q> to on the spot.<lb/> land a flash, somehow, all was
                    different; the tremendous wave I<lb/> speak of had swept something away. It had
                    knocked down, I<lb/> suppose, my little customary altar, my twinkling tapers and
                    my<lb/> flowers, and had reared itself into the likeness of a temple vast
                    and<lb/> bare. When <persName type="fictional">Neil Paraday</persName> should
                    come out of the house he would<lb/> come out a contemporary. That was what had
                    happened — the<lb/> poor man was to be squeezed into his horrible age. I
                    felt as if<lb/> he had been overtaken on the crest of the hill and brought
                    back<lb/> to the city. A little more and he would have dipped down to<lb/>
                    posterity and escaped.</p></div><div type="part" n="4"><head>IV</head><space/><p>When he came out it was exactly as if he had been in custody,<lb/> for beside him
                    walked a stout man with a big black beard, who,<lb/> save that he wore

                    were tossing terrified under his<lb/> bows. I saw that his momentum was
                    irresistible, <q>"I was<lb/> confident that I should be the first in the

                        so very interesting — something to<lb/> start with,"</q> he smiled.
                    He had begun to pull off his gloves,<lb/> which were violently new, and to look
                    encouragingly round the<lb/> little garden. As a <q>"surrounding"</q> I felt
                    that I myself had<lb/> already been taken in; I was a little fish in the stomach
                    of a<lb/> bigger one. <q>"I represent,"</q> our visitor continued, <q>"a
                        syndicate of<lb/> influential journals, no less than thirty-seven, whose
                        public —<lb/> whose publics, I may say — are in peculiar
                        sympathy with <persName type="fictional">Mr.<lb/> Paraday's</persName> line
                        of thought. They would greatly appreciate any<lb/> expression of his views
                        on the subject of the art he so brilliantly<lb/> practises. Besides my
                        connection with the syndicate just men-<lb/> tioned, I hold a particular
                        commission from <title level="j" rend="italic">The Tatler</title>,
                        whose<lb/> most prominent department, <title level="j" rend="italic">Smatter

                        — attracts such attention. I was honoured<lb/> only last week, as a

                        the confi-<lb/> dence of <persName type="fictional">Guy

                        my sketch of her<lb/> method; she went so far as to say that I had made her
                        genius<lb/> more comprehensible even to herself."</q></p><p><persName type="fictional">Neil Paraday</persName> had dropped upon the
                    garden-bench and sat there,<lb/> at once detached and confused; he looked hard
                    at a bare spot in <lb/> the lawn, as if with an anxiety that had suddenly made

                    taken<lb/> official possession and that there was no undoing it. One had<lb/>
                    heard of unfortunate people's having <soCalled>a man in the house,</soCalled>
                    and<lb/> this was just what we had. There was a silence of a moment,<lb/> during
                    which we seemed to acknowledge in the only way that<lb/> was possible the
                    presence of universal fate; the sunny stillness<lb/> took no pity, and my
                    thought, as I was sure <persName type="fictional">Paraday</persName>'s was
                    doing,<lb/> performed within the minute a great distant revolution. I saw<lb/>
                    just how emphatic I should make my rejoinder to <persName type="fictional">Mr.

                    long as possible to save. Not because I had brought<lb/> my mind back, but
                    because our visitor's last words were in my<lb/> ear, I presently inquired with
                    gloomy irrelevance if <persName type="fictional">Guy Wals-<lb/>

                        <q>"Is this <persName type="fictional">Miss Forbes</persName> a
                        gentleman?"</q></p><p><persName type="fictional">Mr. Morrow</persName> hesitated an instant, smiling:
                        <q>"It wouldn't be<lb/><q>"Miss"</q> — there's a wife!"</q></p><fw type="catchword">I</fw><pb n="29"/><fw type="runningHead">By Henry James</fw><fw type="pageNum">21</fw><p><q>"I mean is she a man?"</q></p><p><q>"The wife?"</q> — <persName type="fictional">Mr. Morrow</persName>, for
                    a moment, was as confused<lb/> as myself. But when I explained that I alluded to
                        <persName type="fictional">Dora Forbes</persName><lb/> in person he informed
                    me, with visible amusement at my being<lb/> so out of it, that this was the
                    pen-name of an indubitable male<lb/> — he had a big red moustache. <q>"He
                        only assumes a feminine<lb/> personality because the ladies are such popular
                        favourites. A great<lb/> deal of interest is felt in this assumption, and
                        there's every pro-<lb/> spect of its being widely imitated."</q> Our host at
                    this moment<lb/> joined us again, and <persName type="fictional">Mr.
                        Morrow</persName> remarked invitingly that he<lb/> should be happy to make a
                    note of any observation the movement<lb/> in question, the bid for success under
                    a lady’s name, might suggest<lb/> to <persName type="fictional">Mr.
                        Paraday</persName>. But the poor man, without catching the allu-<lb/> tion,
                    excused himself, pleading that, though he was greatly<lb/> honoured by his
                    visitor's interest, he suddenly felt unwell and<lb/> should have to take leave
                    of him — have to go and lie down and<lb/> keep quiet. His young friend
                    might be trusted to answer for<lb/> him, but he hoped <persName type="fictional">Mr. Morrow</persName> didn't expect great things even<lb/> of his young
                    friend. His young friend, at this moment, looked<lb/> at <persName type="fictional">Neil Paraday</persName> with an anxious eye, greatly
                    wondering if he were<lb/> doomed to be ill again; but <persName type="fictional">Paraday</persName>'s own kind face met his ques-<lb/> tion reassuringly,
                    seemed to say in a glance intelligible enough:<lb/><q>"Oh, I'm not ill, but I'm scared: get him out of the house as<lb/> quietly as
                        possible."</q> Getting newspaper-men out of the house was<lb/> odd business
                    for an emissary of <persName type="fictional">Mr. Pinhorn</persName>, and I was
                    so exhila-<lb/> rated by the idea of it that I called after him as he left
                    us:</p><p><q>"Read the article in <title level="j" rend="italic">The Empire</title>, and
                        you'll soon be all<lb/> right!"</q></p></div><pb n="30"/><fw type="pageNum">22</fw><fw type="runningHead">The Death of the Lion</fw><div type="part" n="5"><head>V</head><space/><p><q>"Delicious my having come down to tell him of it!"</q><persName type="fictional">Mr.<lb/> Morrow</persName> ejaculated. <q>"My cab was
                        at the door twenty minutes<lb/> after <title level="j" rend="italic">The
                            Empire</title> had been laid upon my breakfast-table. Now<lb/> what have
                        you got for me?"</q> he continued, dropping again into<lb/> his chair, from
                    which, however, the next moment he quickly<lb/> rose. <q>"I was shown into the
                        drawing-room, but there must be<lb/> more to see—his study, his
                        literary sanctum, the little things he<lb/> has about, or other domestic
                        objects or features. He wouldn't be<lb/> lying down on his study-table?
                        There's a great interest always<lb/> felt in the scene of an author's
                        labours. Sometimes we're favoured<lb/> with very delightful peeps. <persName type="fictional">Dora Forbes</persName> showed me all his table-<lb/>
                        drawers, and almost jammed my hand into one into which I made<lb/> a dash! I
                        don't ask that of you, but if we could talk things<lb/> over right there
                        where he sits I feel as if I should get the<lb/> keynote."</q></p><p>I had no wish whatever to be rude to <persName type="fictional">Mr.
                        Morrow</persName>, I was<lb/> much too initiated not to prefer the safety of
                    other ways; but I<lb/> had a quick inspiration and I entertained an
                    insurmountable, an<lb/> almost superstitious objection to his crossing the
                    threshold of my<lb/> friend's little lonely, shabby, consecrated workshop.
                        <q>"No,<lb/> we sha'n't get at his lire that way,"</q> I said. <q>"The way
                        to get at<lb/> his lire is to — But wait a moment!"</q> I broke off
                    and went<lb/> quickly into the house; then, in three minutes, I reappeared before<lb/><persName type="fictional">Mr. Morrow</persName> with the two volumes of
                        <persName type="fictional">Paraday</persName>'s new book.<lb/><q>"His life's here"</q> I went on, <q>"and I'm so full of this admirable<lb/>
                        thing that I can't talk of anything else. The artist's life's his<lb/> work,

                        <q>"Do you mean to<lb/> say that no other source of information should be
                        opened to us?"</q></p><p><q>"None other till this particular one — by far the most copious
                        —<lb/> has been quite exhausted. Have you exhausted it, my dear

                        in our time almost wholly neglected, and something should<lb/> surely be
                        done to restore its ruined credit. It's the course to<lb/> which the artist
                        himself at every step, and with such pathetic<lb/> confidence, refers us.
                        This last book of <persName type="fictional">Mr. Paraday</persName>'s is
                        full of<lb/> revelations."</q></p><p><q>"Revelations."</q> panted <persName type="fictional">Mr. Morrow</persName>,
                    whom I had forced<lb/> again into his chair.</p><p><q>"The only kind that count. It tells you with a perfection that<lb/> seems to

                        Morrow</persName>, who had picked<lb/> up the second volume and was
                    insincerely thumbing it.</p><p><q>"Everywhere — in the whole treatment of his case. Extract the<lb/>
                        opinion, disengage the answer — those are the real acts of
                        homage."</q></p><p><persName type="fictional">Mr. Morrow</persName>, after a minute, tossed the book
                    away. <q>"Ah, but<lb/> you mustn't take me for a reviewer."</q></p><p><q>"Heaven forbid I should take you for anything so dreadful!<lb/> You came down
                        to perform a little act of sympathy, and so, I<lb/> may confide to you, did
                        I. Let us perform our little act together.<lb/> These pages overflow with
                        the testimony we want: let us read<lb/> them and taste them and interpret
                        them. You will of course<lb/> have perceived for yourself that one scarcely
                        does read <persName type="fictional">Neil<lb/> Paraday</persName> till one
                        reads him aloud; he gives out to the ear an extra-<lb/> Ordinary quality,
                        and it's only when you expose it confidently to<lb/></q></p><fw type="catchword">that</fw><pb n="32"/><fw type="pageNum">24</fw><fw type="runningHead">The Death of the Lion</fw><p><q>that test that you really get near his style. Take up your book<lb/> again
                        and let me listen, while you pay it out, to that wonderful<lb/> fifteenth
                        chapter. If you feel that you can't do it justice, compose<lb/> yourself to
                        attention while I produce for you — I think I can! —<lb/> this
                        scarcely less admirable ninth."</q></p><p><persName type="fictional">Mr. Morrow</persName> gave me a straight glance which
                    was as hard as a<lb/> blow between the eyes; he had turned rather red and a
                    question had<lb/> formed itselfin his mind which reached my sense as distinctly
                    as if<lb/> he had uttered it: <q>"What sort of a damned fool are you?"</q>
                    Then<lb/> he got up, gathering together his hat and gloves, buttoning his<lb/>
                    coat, projecting hungrily all over the place the big transparency of<lb/> his
                    mask. It seemed to flare over <placeName type="street">Fleet Street</placeName>
                    and somehow<lb/> made the actual spot distressingly humble: there was so little
                    for<lb/> it to feed on unless he counted the blisters of our stucco or saw<lb/>
                    his way to do something with the roses. Even the poor roses<lb/> were common
                    kinds. Presently his eyes fell upon the manuscript<lb/> from which <persName type="fictional">Paraday</persName> had been reading to me and which still
                    lay on<lb/> the bench. As my own followed them I saw that it looked<lb/>
                    promising, looked pregnant, as if it gently throbbed with the lire<lb/> the
                    reader had given it. <persName type="fictional">Mr. Morrow</persName> indulged
                    in a nod toward<lb/> it and a vague thrust of his umbrella. <q>"What's
                        that?"</q></p><p><q>"Oh, it's a plan — a secret."</q></p><p><q>"A secret!"</q> There was an instant's silence, and then <persName type="fictional">Mr.<lb/> Morrow</persName> made another movement. I may
                    have been mistaken,<lb/> but it affected me as the translated impulse of the
                    desire to lay<lb/> hands on the manuscript, and this led me to indulge in a
                    quick<lb/> anticipatory grab which may very well have seemed ungraceful, or<lb/>
                    even impertinent, and which at any rate left <persName type="fictional">Mr.
                        Paraday</persName>'s two<lb/> admirers very erect, glaring at each other
                    while one of them held<lb/> a bundle of papers well behind him. An instant later
                        <persName type="fictional">Mr.<lb/> Morrow</persName> quitted me abruptly,
                    as if he had really carried some-<lb/></p><fw type="catchword">thing</fw><pb n="33"/><fw type="runningHead">By Henry James</fw><fw type="pageNum">25</fw><p>thing away. To reassure myself, watching his broad back recede,<lb/> I only
                    grasped my manuscript the tighter. He went to the<lb/> back-door of the house,
                    the one he had come out from, but on<lb/> trying the handle he appeared to find
                    it fastened. So he passed<lb/> round into the front garden, and, by listening
                    intently enough, I<lb/> could presently hear the outer gate close behind him
                    with a bang.<lb/> I thought again of the thirty-seven influential journals
                    and<lb/> wondered what would be his revenge. I hasten to add that he was<lb/>
                    rnagnanimous: which was just the most dreadful thing he could<lb/> have been.

                    influential journals it went, to use <persName type="fictional">Mr.

                    may be veraciously recorded, he was the king of<lb/> the beasts of the year. No
                    advancement was ever more rapid, no<lb/> exaltation more complete, no
                    bewilderment more teachable. His<lb/> book sold but moderately, though the
                    article in <title level="j" rend="italic">The Empire</title> had<lb/> done
                    unwonted wonders for it; but he circulated in person in a<lb/> manner that the
                    libraries might well have envied. His formula<lb/> had been found — he
                    was a revelation. His momentary terror<lb/> had been real, just as mine had been
                    — the overclouding of his<lb/> passionate desire to be left to finish his
                    work. He was far from<lb/> unsociable, but he had the finest conception of being
                    let alone<lb/> that I have ever met. For the time, however, he took his

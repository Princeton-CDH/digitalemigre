            <p>Introduction. The Yellow Nineties Online publishes primary texts from the 1890s and
               secondary texts written by critics of fin-de-siècle culture. Both kinds of texts are
               marked up in TEI. As a dynamic structure, a scholarly website is always in process.
               Our decisions in selecting and presenting materials on The Yellow Nineties Online are
               governed by the following principles. Editorial Principles 1. Primary materials Our
               editorial method for the facsimile editions published here is informed by social-text
               editing principles. The editors understand text as including visual and verbal
               printed material, including non-referential physical elements such as page design,
               ornament, and binding. We view any text as the outcome of a collaborative process
               that has specific material manifestations at precise historical moments. We have
               chosen to reproduce The Yellow Book in facsimile form at its moment of first
               publication. The social moment—and our editorial horizon—is demarcated by the decade
               of the 1890s as experienced in and around the London contexts of The Yellow Book’s
               contributors and associates. The project’s principal interest is in presenting the
               text’s physical components in its first edition, with attention to its production and
               reception. Copy-text for The Yellow Book and any other primary material edited on The
               Yellow Nineties Online is the first edition unless otherwise noted. The Yellow Book
               is presented in facsimile, using double-page opening of the flip-book function. In
               addition, the physical features, verbal texts, and visual images of each Yellow Book
               volume are marked up in TEI and available in both xml and PDF formats. Annotations to
               the facsimile edition are kept to a minimum. Commentary is available in the site’s
               associated secondary materials. 2. Secondary materials In addition to providing the
               publication vehicle for the marked-up facsimile edition of The Yellow Book, The
               Yellow Nineties Online is also an electronic publishing site for peer-reviewed
               material relating to The Yellow Book and fin-de-siècle cultural studies. Secondary
               material published on the site has three levels of review. First, the editors solicit
               and co-edit commentary from leading scholars in the field. Second, the site is
               overseen by an international Editorial Board of experts. Third, the site will be
               submitted to NINES (Networked Interface for Nineteenth-Century Electronic
               Scholarship) for blind vetting in 2011. Once accepted by NINES, The Yellow Nineties
               Online will be associated with a large consortium of electronic scholarship and
               available for aggregated searches online. At this time, the editors’ priority in
               selecting secondary material is to make available a biography for each person who
               contributed to, or was associated with, the individual volumes of The Yellow Book.
               Each of these biographies is accompanied by a list of writings by, and about, the
               contributor. The editors also seek to publish high-quality essays on relevant aspects
               of The Yellow Book’s production and reception as an illustrated periodical. We are
               particularly interested in material relating to the aesthetic, bibliographic,
               cultural, institutional, personal, and technological contexts of its publication.
               Editorial Guidelines for Contributors of Biographies 1. FORMAT and CONTENT TEMPLATE
               Person’s Name: FIRST, LAST (BIRTH AND DEATH DATE) (flush left) i.e. Ella D’Arcy

               important influences. b) Extended commentary on career, including important
               contributions to literary, artistic, cultural, social and/or publishing history. Keep
               quotations from other sources to a minimum. c) Connections to key works, events, and
               participants of the Victorian fin de siècle particularly warrant mention. 2. STYLE
